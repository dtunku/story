the morning frenzy

a long day's watch after a sleepless night
eyes watery and pale
the moring brought a ring as the bells in the catheral
barely making our the sounds around
it was a nightly terror
now you hope you can deal with anymore
it's been only an hour
here you are with a bulging eyes
a noisy ear and a clouded head
it was nolonger the bills
it was not the bills
it was was.
