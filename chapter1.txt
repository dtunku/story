In the middle of it all,
dispair is never far,
hope lost in the midst
the glims of light only in dreams
when the day's light is dark as night
when the night is as sure as day
the dark never cease nor part
to part is to give way to hope
far from what is says
for you know what it is 
you had thought of it before hand
and now though oblivious
others take pity of you
a well deserved knock
you know it for you've been told.
